Application cases
=================

[Application case: relevant files]

Combining comparative genomics with data integration for the prediction of potential pathogenicity genes:
botrytis_phibase.oxl (Ondex graph), Integrator workflow to obtain graph is given in Data_integration/Integrator directory,
botrytis_phibase.pdf (slides to help tuturial participants to build workflow)

Exploring interactions in Arabidopsis: ppi_aba_cluster.xml.gz (Ondex graph to be opened), 
ppi_full_network.oxl (full ppi network), no Integrator workflow available,
ppi.pdf (slides to introduce the data and all the various attributes)

Analysing experimental data in the context of integrated biological networks:
pathways_expdata.oxl (Ondex graph), pathways_expdata_integrator_workflow.xml (Integrator workflow to obtain graph)

Candidate genes for biomass traits: biomass_knowledge_base_subset.oxl  (Ondex graph to be opened), 
biomass_integrator_workflow.xml (Integrator workflow to obtain graph),
biomass.pdf (slides introducing the data)
