[Filename: description]


botrytis_cinerea_1_proteins.fasta.gz: the botrytis genome sequence

short.fasta: the first 10% of the botrytis genome sequence

phi_base_3_1.xml: the Phi-base database (http://www.phi-base.org/)

blast_installers folder: install the BLAST you need

short_botrytis_results.xml.gz: results obtained with short.fasta (to load in Ondex)

workflow.xml: your workflow should look similar to this one

botrytis_phibase.xml.gz: results of the integrator workflow with full botrytis genome rather
than short.fasta (not in this directory but in the "Application_cases" folder)

pre-integrated_step_inparanoid_results.xml.gz: This graph contains the results of importing phi_base_3_1.xml, 
short.fasta and running the inparanoid mapping method.
