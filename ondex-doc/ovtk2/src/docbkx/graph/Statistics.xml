	Launching "Statistics" from the Network menu will result in the following window.

	When selecting an attribute as a variable the statistics window will show results.
	If the given variable is a string then the histogram will remain empty.
	However the number of concepts (|C|) or relations (|R|) involved will be given.
	In the example below, 401 concepts have a GDS (Generalized Data Store) attribute of type "phenotype".

	In the next example, CONF (confidence factor that the relations are indeed linking paralogs or orthologs)
	has been selected.
	As it is a number (rather than a string), it is possible for the tool to plot a histogram.

	In the next figure, a concept class was also selected (Protein).
	This modified the graph as well as |R| which decreased from 1326 to 703 relations involved.

	Furthermore, if a relation type is also selected ("para" for paralog in this case)
	the histogram is changed again and 61 relations are now concerned.
