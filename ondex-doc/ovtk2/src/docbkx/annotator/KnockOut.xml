	<title>Virtual Knock-Out</title>
	<para>
		This annotator can be used to see how important a single concept
		is to all possible paths contained in a network. The first column
		entitled "cid" gives the concept identifier. The second column
		entitled "concept name" indeed gives the concept name.
	</para>
	<para>
		The third column entitled "extension" gives the number of paths
		that would be extended if a concept was added. The fourth column
		entitled "deletion" gives the number of paths that would be deleted if
		this concept was deleted. The fifth column entitled "nochange" gives
		the number of paths that would not be shortened/extended if this
		concept was deleted.
	</para>
	<para>
		The sixth column entitled "score" gives the score computed by the
		knock-out annotator for this concept based on the results in the last
		three columns. The OVTK resizes the concepts based on this score.
	</para>
	<para>
		The seventh column entitled "diameter" gives the length of the
		longest shortest path in the subgraph which contains the concept. The
		eighth column entitled "components" gives the number of connected
		components (connected graphs) that would be left over after the
		deletion of the concept.

		The yellow circle indeed represents the concept which would
		change this particular cluster of concepts the most. It is also
		possible to export the results to an CSV file by using the "Export
		results" button.
