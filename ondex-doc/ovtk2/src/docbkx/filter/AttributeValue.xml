	<title>Attribute Value Matcher</title>
	<para>
		This filter allows users to filter out concepts or relations that
		have an attribute with a particular value. In order to illustrate how
		it works, the Colour Concepts by General Attribute Annotator was run
		on the data prior to this first screenshot. The colour legend shows
		the phenotype of each concept. Let's try to delete all concepts that
		carry the phenotype "Loss of pathogenicity". This should eliminate the
		green concepts within this isolated cluster.

		As a user, you may select "concepts" or "relations", a type of
		attribute ("Phenotype" in this case) and a value for that attribute
		(here "Loss of pathogenicity").
