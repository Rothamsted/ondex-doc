		The Subgraph Filter allows users to select root concept(s) in the
		network along with the types of concepts and relations they wish to
		view from the root concept(s). Users can select one or several root
		concept(s) from the filter's top window. Alternatively, they can
		select concept(s) from the visualisation window before starting the
		Subgraph Filter from the Tools menu (they will be automatically
		selected in the list shown in the filter's top window).

		Ticking the "non-redundant meta data selection" option before
		applying the filter will show the actual path that was selected only.
		For example, this means going from disease concept (in yellow) to the
		linked interactions (in blue) to some proteins (in red) and stopping
		there. Going from these proteins back to interactions and so on is
		considered "redundant".
