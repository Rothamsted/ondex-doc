	<para>
		The Connectivity layout is a mixture of the circular and
		hierarchical layout. Users need to select concepts in the network in
		which connectivity they are interested before opening the layout. The
		layout will show these selected concepts (in yellow) in a first
		circle. A second circle will be displayed to the right of the first
		one, showing all the concepts that are not connected to the concepts
		in the first circle. To the left of the first circle, a customisable
		number of rows are displayed showing a hierarchy of concepts. This
		hierarchy is based on the connectivity of the concepts in these rows
		to all the concepts in the first circle. The top row shows the
		concepts that are most connected.
