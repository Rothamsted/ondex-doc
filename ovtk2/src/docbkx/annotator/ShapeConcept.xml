	<title>Shape Concepts by General Attribute</title>
	<para>
		The Shape Concepts by General Attribute Annotator allows users to
		select shapes for each specified attribute. In the following example
		we choose to show the shape of concepts based on the Taxonomy
		identifier. A few pre-steps are required here to know what Taxonomy
		identifier a concept actually holds. The item information panel can be
		used to show the Taxonomy identifier.

		We enter 5476 as a Taxonomy_ID and select a shape of our choice.
		After clicking on "Annotate Graph" and clicking anywhere on the
		network, we can see the shape of the concepts we had checked is now
		modified to a star.

		For a different Taxonomy identifier (5482), it is possible to
		select a different shape. Note: This requires a new annotator window.
		Adding another identifier to the same annotator window would make both
		identifiers shown with the same shape.
