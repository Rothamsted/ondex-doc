        Ondex is used to visualize networks
        produced by running a workflow (traditionally written in xml format).
        The "Integrator" allows users to prepare and run a workflow within Ondex.

        All of the available steps are documented under "Developer\Document".
        A simple example for a workflow is to first select parsers (to import data)
        then do select mapping methods and, finally, to select some filtering so as to improve the quality of the graph.
