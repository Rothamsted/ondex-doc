\section{Installation}
\label{sec:ref_install}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Requirements}
\textbf{Hardware: }Ondex requires at least
\begin{itemize}
\item 2GHz CPU
\item 2GB RAM (4GB recommended)
\item 300 MB of free HDD space
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Operating system: }Ondex is a Java 6 application and therefore compatible with
\begin{itemize}
\item Windows XP / Vista / 7
\item Linux / UNIX / Solaris
\item Mac OS X 64-bit Intel (as this version supports Java 6)
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Software: }Ondex needs Java version 6 update 26 or later versions.
Make sure you have an adequate Java Runtime Environment installed on your system.
If not, you can download it from {\url{http://java.oracle.com}}.

Also make sure your PATH variable contains your java executable. 
To test whether this is the case, see section \ref{sec:testing_requirements} below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Installer}
There is an Ondex installer for Windows users. 
For Windows Vista / 7: Make sure NOT to install Ondex in ``C:$\backslash$Program Files (x86)''.

In the Ondex setup, the page ``Choose Components'' (see Figure \ref{fig:choose_components}) 
lets the user decide which features of Ondex they wish to install.
Several options are possible:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ondex front-end plug-ins
\item Ondex front-end plug-ins (including experimental)
\item All Ondex front-end and Integrator plug-ins
\item All Ondex front-end and Integrator plug-ins (including experimental)
\item Custom
\end{enumerate}
The first option will allow users to use data visualisation tools which are stable.
The second option will allow users to use data visualisation tools which are stable as well as experimental.
The third option will allow users to use data visualisation and integration tools which are stable.
The fourth option will allow users to use data visualisation and integration tools which are stable as well as experimental.
The fifth option will allow users to customize their setup and manually select what they wish to install.
(For this fifth option, the plug-ins selected by default depend on what option out of the first four was last selected.)

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/Oct12/choose_components.png} 
\caption{Ondex Setup - Choose Components}
\label{fig:choose_components}
\end{figure}

During the installation, the Ondex setup (see figure \ref{fig:choose_memory}) 
will prompt the user to specify the default amount of memory Ondex should run with. 
This number should be set to 1200 for 32-bit systems with at least 2GB memory. 
For 64-bit systems it can be set to just under the amount of memory you have installed, 
\textit{e.g.} set it to 3500 on a system with 4GB of memory.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{images/Oct12/choose_memory.png} 
\caption{Ondex Setup - Configure memory}
\label{fig:choose_memory}
\end{figure} 

The installer will create shortcuts (which users can then access from the Start menu) unless stated otherwise during the setup.
Running the exe file for Ondex (using this shortcut or by double-clicking on it) will check that Java Runtime Environment version 1.6 or higher is installed.
If it is not, it will attempt to automatically download it.

Users of other operating systems may download the tar.gz file and execute the runme.sh file to start Ondex.
In Linux, a ``chmod 755 runme.sh'' might be needed to make the script executable from your user's account.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Testing the requirements}
\label{sec:testing_requirements}

\textbf{WINDOWS: }
Click Start -$>$ Run enter ``cmd'' and press enter. 

\noindent\textbf{LINUX/GNOME: }
Right-click on your desktop and choose ``Open Terminal'' from the appearing context menu.

\noindent\textbf{LINUX/KDE: }
Choose ``Konsole'' from your Quick launcher.

Type ``java -version'' in the appearing console window and press enter.
If your system is configured correctly you will see a message that contains your current Java version. Make sure it is higher than version 1.6.
If you don't see a message, then you have either not installed Java yet, or you have not set your PATH variable.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{How to set the PATH variable}
\textbf{WINDOWS: }
Right-click on ``Computer'' in the start menu and choose ``Properties'' from the appearing context menu. 
Click on ``Advanced system settings'' on the left in the appearing window. 
Click the button ``Environment Variables'' on the bottom left of the window. 
You will see a list of variables with their assigned values. 
If the PATH variable already occurs in it, select it and click ``Edit''. 
Append a semicolon to the end of the value field and then enter the path to your Java binary directory. 
This is usually something like ``C:$\backslash$Program Files$\backslash$Java$\backslash$jdk1.6.0\_26$\backslash$bin''.
If the path contains any white spaces, make sure you put it in double quotes. 
If the variable PATH didn't exist yet on your system, create a new one and call it ``PATH''. 
Assign the binary path as it's value. However you don't need the semicolon in this case.

\noindent\textbf{LINUX: }
Go to your home directory and open the file ``.bashrc'' in your favourite editor. 
Append the line PATH=\$PATH:$<$javadir$>$ where $<$javadir$>$ is your path to the java binary directory, 
something like $/usr/java/latest/bin/$ to find out what it actually is you can execute the command ``type java'' in a console window. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{To the attention of sysadmins}
A ``system-wide install'' of Ondex is discouraged because putting the Ondex directory tree 
in root space makes it hard for users to manage input, output, scripts and databases. 
Installing Ondex in users' spaces or creating an Ondex user is a good alternative. 

Databases will mostly have to be obtained by the sysadmin/users as flatfiles on a need-to-use basis. 
The expected location of those files is under $<$OndexDir$>$/data/importdata/ 
(where $<$OndexDir$>$ is the directory where Ondex was installed).

For a dataset which an average user is expecting to employ, it is essential to use a machine with enough memory.
It is also essential to increase the memory setting in the command line or runme file to run Ondex with more memory. 
Ondex's GUI can currently manage about 250,000 concepts and relations.
Limitations depend on available memory and CPU.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Using Ondex behind a firewall}
In order to use Ondex when working behind a firewall, please modify the last line of runme.bat or runme.sh as follows:\\
\texttt{java -DproxySet=true -DproxyHost=your.proxy.com -DproxyPort=yourport -Dhttp.proxyUser=yourproxyuser -Dhttp.proxyPassword=yourproxypassword
-Xmx\%MEMORY\% -Dondex.dir=\%DATA\% -Dovtk.dir=\%OVTK\_DATA\% -Dplugin.scan.lib=false \ldots}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Loading Networks}
\label{sec:ref_loading}
It is possible to open biological networks in Ondex by:
\begin{itemize}
\item Importing network files.
\item Creating an empty network and manually adding concepts and relations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Loading Existing Biological Networks into Ondex}
Ondex can read files written in the following formats:
\begin{itemize}
\item oxl (Ondex XML, biological networks created using Ondex)
\item nwb (Network Workbench \url{http://nwb.cns.iu.edu/})
\item net (Pajek \url{http://pajek.imfm.si/doku.php?id=pajek})
\item cys (CytoScape \url{http://www.cytoscape.org})
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Creating an empty network and manually adding concepts and relations}
It is also possible to create a new, empty network and to manually add concepts and relations. 
To create an empty network, go to File -$>$ New. 
Click on the magic wand icon for ``Add a Concept or Relation'' or go to Edit -$>$ Concept / Relation -$>$ Add New.

If you wish to add a concept, click on ``Add a new Concept''. 
You will need to fill in all the fields highlighted in orange as they are compulsory. 
This will require creating Data Source and Concept Class identifiers and an Evidence Type.

If you wish to add a relation, click on ``Add a new Relation''. 
You will need to select concepts beforehand (shift + left mouse button to create a select area) 
so the drop-down lists offer these concepts as origin / target of the relation.
It maybe necessary to create a Relation Type identifier.

\subsection{Saving Files}
\label{sec:ref_sav}
You can save your Ondex files and export visualisations.
\begin{itemize}
\item To save a file, go to File -$>$ Save graph as. The panel on the right offers options
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Save invisible concepts/relations: if hidden items have not been deleted from the graph yet, you can untick this option to delete them before saving.
	\item Save appearance: will save colours, shapes, sizes and layout of concepts and relations.
	\end{itemize}
\item To save images from the visualization window, go to File -$>$ Save image as
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Select an export format from the list
	\item Scale factor: will scale the visualisation by the given factor before saving
	\end{itemize}
\item To export the graph to another format, go to File -$>$ Export
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Select an export format from the list
	\item Scale factor (only applicable to some export formats)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Metagraph}
\label{sec:ref_metagraph}

The Metagraph view has 2 buttons at the bottom of its window:
\begin{itemize}
\item Legend: will pop up a window which displays a modifiable colour/shape legend as well as 
the number of concepts and relations in the network for concept classes, data sources, relation types and evidence types
\item Main Network: will open the main network visualisation window if it was minimized 
\end{itemize}

The Metagraph view has its own menu system:
\begin{itemize}
\item File
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Export: will export the metagraph as an image (see Section \ref{sec:ref_sav} for more information)
	\end{itemize}
\item Edit
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Show All/Selection: Set items on the metagraph to visible - All or a selection (select using left click, press shift to select several items)
	\item Hide All/Selection: Set items on the metagraph to invisible - All or a selection (select using left click, press shift to select several items)
	\end{itemize}
\item Appearance
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Labels: show the labels of meta concepts / meta relations on the metagraph
	\item Config: change the meta relation thickness, meta concept size and font size showing on the metagraph
	\item Scale to Fit: after resizing the window, will scale the metagraph to fit it
	\item Refresh Layout: will draw the metagraph again should users have moved anything and will end with a ``Scale to Fit''
	\item Load Appearance: loads previously saved layout and sizes of the metagraph
	\item Save Appearance: saves current layout and sizes of the metagraph  
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Manipulating Networks}
\label{sec:ref_manipulating}

There are several ways of manipulating networks in Ondex:

\begin{itemize}

\item Zooming
Ondex provides two mechanisms for zooming:
\begin{itemize}
\item Using the mouse - move the mouse scroll forwards and backwards (the graph moves towards you and away from you respectively)
\item Using the two zoom buttons on the toolbar to zoom in and out of the network (or Appearance -$>$ Zoom)
\item Using a combination of the mouse and the zoom buttons, you can zoom in on a group of concepts -
press shift to select a few concepts with the left mouse button, zoom in on the selected group
\end{itemize}

\item Selecting an area to look at from the overview
When studying large graphs, using the View -$>$ Satellite View to move and navigate across the network can be very useful.

\item Manually rearrange a network
Select the concepts of interest and move them around. See last exercise (and help points) in Section \ref{sec:loading}.

\item Automatically rearrange a network
There are a variety of layout algorithms which can be found in the Appearance -$>$ Layouts menu. 
The Gem layout is the most popular one.

\item Rotating and Sheering your network
Finally you can rotate and scale your network within Ondex. 
In the transforming mode (See Section \ref{sec:ref_icons} for icon or, in the menus, Edit -$>$ Mouse Mode), 
shift + mouse will rotate and control + mouse will sheer your graph.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Buttons in toolbar}
\label{sec:ref_icons}

The toolbar is composed of several icons followed by a search bar which is explained in further details in Section \ref{sec:search}.
It is possible to undock this toolbar by a simple ``drag and drop''. 
When it is undocked, it is possible to re-dock it by clicking on its far left side and again dragging and dropping to its original position.

\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{images/Oct12/icon_mouse_modes.png} 
\caption{The left-hand side icon sets the mouse to ``transforming'' mode (to move within the network) whereas the
white hand icon sets the mouse to ``picking'' mode (to select concepts, drag and drop them).
When a graph is not dense, the two modes interchange depending on the position of the mouse (positioned over blank or over concept or relation).
When a graph is dense, manually selecting a mode can be useful.
The black hand sets the mouse to ``annotating'' mode for annotation purposes.
All available from Edit -$>$ Mouse mode.}
\label{fig:icon_mouse_modes}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Search bar in toolbar}
\label{sec:ref_search}
Ondex includes a Search feature, which enables you to quickly find concepts by searching their names, accessions and other properties. 
The default mode of the Search feature is Keyword search, other modes like chemical similarity or UniProt identifier are also available.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{images/Oct12/search_bar.png} 
\label{fig:search_bar}
\caption{Search bar}
\end{figure}

If you select (single click) one item in the search results, you will need to click on the icon ``Zoom In'' in order for Ondex to zoom in on this particular concept. 
You can then use the mouse scroll functionality to get to the concept.
If you select several items (using the Control key) in the search results, Ondex will automatically zoom in to show all those items as close up as possible.

\textbf{Configuring an Ondex Search }
\begin{itemize}
\item At the end of the toolbar in Keyword search mode, there are 2 options that can be configured for each search. 
If you tick ``Regular Expr.'', you may enter a JAVA regular expression. An example would be: p$\backslash$$\backslash$d\{1,4\}.
It will match a ``p'' followed by 1 to 4 digits. 
For more information on regular expressions in JAVA, please visit \url{http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/}.
If you tick ``Case Sensitive'', the search will be sensitive to lower/upper case of each character.
\item Under the search box, there are 3 drop-down lists which allow users to restrict their search (by Concept Class, Data Source or Tag).
\end{itemize}

      \item Colour Concepts with Series Data:
      Colours concepts according to a list of numerical attributes. 
      The user can iterate over this list to select the attribute mapped to concept colour. 
      For example, iterating through expression values of different time points of a micro-array experiment one after the other.
      \item Colour Relations by Concept Tag Intersection:
      to colour relations green if the two concepts they link have more than one tag in common, red otherwise
      \item Concept Degree:
      Creates attributes ("IN\_DEGREE", "OUT\_DEGREE", "BOTH\_DEGREE") on the concepts which reflect the in- and out-degrees of the node corresponding to the concept. 
      This annotator does not change the visualisation of the graph (please apply the Attribute Value Matcher filter to do so).
      \item Degree Specificity:
      Creates attributes on the concepts and/or relations which reflect a certain set of concept class connectivity.
      \item Display Series Data on Concepts:
      Draw line or bar graphs on the nodes in the network, visualising the time series data selected.
      \item Graph Algorithms:
      to select one of five algorithms (all cliques, connected components, cut
      concepts, minimum equivalent, strongly connected). 
      Results are added as attributes to the concepts.
      \item Relation Betweenness Clusterer:
      Adds an attribute (true/false) to a chosen number of relations that have the highest betweenness measure. 
      This annotator does not change the visualisation of the graph (please apply a filter to do so). 
      After applying a filter (e.g. the Attribute Value Matcher filter), the graph would show highly connected components.
      \item Scale Concepts/Relations by Type:
      to choose the size of concepts/relations for each concept class and relation type
      \item Virtual Knock-Out:
      to remove one concept at a time virtually and calculating the structure changes in the network
      \item Weighting Relation Attribute:
      to add an attribute to relations which corresponds to a weighted calculation of the existing attributes (only works on networks where all relations have attributes)

\section{Integrator}
\label{sec:ref_integrator}
The Ondex Integrator is Ondex's workflow manager. It is available from the Tools menu and looks like this
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{images/Oct12/integrator.png} 
\caption{Integrator}
\label{fig:integrator}
\end{figure}
There 3 main areas to the Ondex Integrator (which are all adjustable using the mouse):
\begin{itemize}
\item Top left: listing panel.
This window lists all the plugins available to add to your workflow.
\item Bottom left: documentation panel.
This window contains 4 tabs and shows documentation for the selected item (single click) in the listing panel above.
\item Right: workflow panel.
Selected plugins (double click) will appear in this window for you to set parameters.
\end{itemize}

Other useful points:
\begin{itemize}
\item File -$>$ Validate allows users to check their workflow before running it.
\item Configure -$>$ ``Show stable plugins only'' can be ticked/unticked to hide/show experimental plugins as well.
\item There is a ``Run workflow'' button at the bottom-right corner. Saving your workflow before running is advised (File -$>$ Save As).
Running the workflow will highlight the name of the plugins in yellow (while running), green (when finished).
A error report pops up when error(s) are found. A ``$>>$'' icon is placed next to each error to show users where each of them is in the pipeline.
The name of the workflow becomes
\begin{itemize}
\item orange while it is running
\item red if running has failed 
\item back to black if it completed successfully
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%Information on the plugins themselves can be found on \url{http://ondex.rothamsted.ac.uk/ondex-plugins/list}.

\section{Console}
\label{sec:ref_console}
The console is Ondex's scripting interface. It is available from the Tools menu and looks like this
\begin{figure}[H]

\caption{Console}
\label{fig:console}
\end{figure}
Section \ref{sec:parsing_tabdel} explains how to import tab-delimited data files using it.

\section{Statistics}
\label{sec:ref_stats}
The statistics module is available from the Tools menu.
You see a window that is divided into 3 main areas as shown in Figure \ref{fig:stats}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Top left: listing panel.
It contains 4 lists with different graph elements that can be used as variables or filters.
\item Top right: selection panel.
It contains the variable field (with two buttons that load it with the currently selected element or unload it, respectively).
The filters list is below the variable field (same buttons to load/unload).
Select from the listing panel and enter in value(s) of your choice.
They will be handled as conditions linked with an ``or'' operation.
\item Bottom: display panel.
It shows the number of concepts that were found that meet the selected conditions and the respective number of relations.
In case the variable is a numerical value, it also features the mean and the standard deviation values, and a histogram.
\end{itemize}
